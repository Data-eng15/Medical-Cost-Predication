🌡️💰 Medical Cost Prediction using Decision Tree 🌳
Project Overview:
The "Medical Cost Prediction using Decision Tree" project is a machine learning initiative aimed at predicting healthcare costs for individuals based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. Leveraging the decision tree algorithm, this project offers valuable insights into the key determinants of medical expenses, assisting both healthcare providers and individuals in financial planning and risk assessment.

Key Features:
Data Collection 📊: A diverse dataset was curated, encompassing information on individuals' demographics, lifestyle choices, and medical charges. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the decision tree model.

Decision Tree Model 🌲: The heart of the project lies in the implementation of a decision tree algorithm. This model analyzes the relationships between different features and predicts medical costs with interpretability, enabling users to understand the factors influencing the predictions.

Interpretability and Transparency 🔍: Decision trees are inherently interpretable, making it easy to grasp the decision-making process. Users can comprehend how each feature contributes to the final prediction, fostering trust in the model's predictions.
Future Enhancements:

Ensemble Methods 🌐: Consider exploring ensemble methods like Random Forests to further improve predictive accuracy and robustness.

Feature Importance Analysis 📈: Conduct an in-depth analysis of feature importance to identify the most significant factors affecting medical costs.

User Profiles 🧑‍💼: Introduce user profiles to save and track individual predictions over time, allowing users to monitor changes in their expected medical expenses.

Technologies Used:
Python 🐍: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
